# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

## About Me

Hi! I'm [Your Name](https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-linkedin-profile), a passionate embedded systems developer with over a year of hands-on experience in firmware development and baremetal embedded programming. I specialize in **Lighting Solutions** and have a deep understanding of hardware and low-level programming. 

I graduated from [CDAC ACTS Pune](https://www.cdac.in/) with a **DESD (Diploma in Embedded System Design)** course, where I honed my skills in embedded systems, programming, and system design.

### My Key Skills:
- **Languages**: 
    - [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
    - [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
    - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
    - [Embedded C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_C)
  
- **Embedded Systems**:
    - Baremetal Embedded Programming
    - Device Drivers
    - Firmware Development for Lighting Solutions
    - Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
    - **Operating Systems**: Linux, FreeRTOS
  
- **Communication Protocols**:
    - [CoAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_Application_Protocol)
    - [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
  
- **File Systems**: FAT, SPIFFS, custom file systems for embedded devices

## Projects

Here are some of my featured projects that showcase my skills and work in embedded systems development:

### [Lighting Control System](https://github.com/your-username/lighting-control-system)
A project where I developed firmware for a lighting solution that integrates with various IoT protocols such as CoAP and HTTP. The system controls lighting remotely through a mobile app, and includes real-time communication with the embedded device.

### [Embedded File System Implementation](https://github.com/your-username/embedded-file-system)
A custom file system developed for embedded devices that allows efficient data storage and retrieval. It integrates with a baremetal application and provides file handling features with minimal overhead.

### [RTOS-based Device Driver](https://github.com/your-username/rtos-device-driver)
A baremetal driver for controlling hardware peripherals using an RTOS. The project demonstrates the design and implementation of device drivers for embedded systems using FreeRTOS.

## Experience

I have over **1 year** of experience working in the embedded systems field, primarily focused on **firmware development** for **lighting solutions**. My expertise includes working with both low-level hardware programming and high-level system integration for embedded applications.

### Previous Roles:
- **Firmware Developer** at [Your Company Name](https://www.yourcompanywebsite.com)
    - Developed firmware for **IoT-based lighting solutions**.
    - Worked extensively with **C/C++** to implement low-level drivers and system protocols.
    - Integrated **CoAP** and **HTTP** for device communication in embedded systems.
    - Implemented **file systems** (FAT, SPIFFS) in constrained embedded environments.

## Education

### [CDAC ACTS Pune](https://www.cdac.in/)
**Diploma in Embedded System Design (DESD)**  
Graduated in [Year].  
Key subjects: Embedded C, RTOS, Device Drivers, Communication Protocols, and Embedded Linux.
