## 🚀 Projects

Here are some of my featured projects that showcase my skills and work in embedded systems development:

### [Lighting Control System 💡](https://github.com/your-username/lighting-control-system)
A project where I developed firmware for a lighting solution that integrates with various IoT protocols such as CoAP and HTTP. The system controls lighting remotely through a mobile app, and includes real-time communication with the embedded device.

### [Embedded File System Implementation 📁](https://github.com/your-username/embedded-file-system)
A custom file system developed for embedded devices that allows efficient data storage and retrieval. It integrates with a baremetal application and provides file handling features with minimal overhead.

### [RTOS-based Device Driver 🚗](https://github.com/your-username/rtos-device-driver)
A baremetal driver for controlling hardware peripherals using an RTOS. The project demonstrates the design and implementation of device drivers for embedded systems using FreeRTOS.

## 💼 Experience

I have over **1 year** of experience working in the embedded systems field, primarily focused on **firmware development** for **lighting solutions**. My expertise includes working with both low-level hardware programming and high-level system integration for embedded applications.

### Previous Roles:
- **Firmware Developer** at [Your Company Name](https://www.yourcompanywebsite.com)
    - Developed firmware for **IoT-based lighting solutions**.
    - Worked extensively with **C/C++** to implement low-level drivers and system protocols.
    - Integrated **CoAP** and **HTTP** for device communication in embedded systems.
    - Implemented **file systems** (FAT, SPIFFS) in constrained embedded environments.

## 🎓 Education
